Hi! I'm not a particularly interesting or accomplished person, but what's a personal site without a personal introduction?

So, well, nice to meet you! My name is Teng, but I go by _trnglina_ online.

One of my favourite (and most time consuming) hobbies is learning Japanese. That's why you'll find lots of references to Japanese popular culture wherever I've gotten my hands. I read a lot of manga, watch quite a bit of [anime](/tags/anime), and occasionally play a JRPG or two. Sometimes I'll write about these here, so please approach with caution.

I also do design for fun---which is one of those things that seems either very normal, or particularly bizarre, depending on your background. I come from a quasi-arts background myself---I've done music and visual arts (though I lacked both talent and patience in both these endeavours). The areas I'm most interested in today are _typography_, and _user interface design_. You can find some of my [design work](/tags/design) on this site (though I warn you, it's mediocre at best).

I also enjoy writing (mostly fiction) but want to stress that I'm no good at it whatsoever. However, if you find yourself yearning for some lackluster, amateur, [fiction](/tags/fiction) or creative [non-fiction](/tags/non-fiction), you can find some on this site as well. I love a great variety of writing, but in particular, I like reading things that instill emotions in me, and I'd like to write things that make others _feel_ as well.

Finally, I'm an amateur programmer---coder, de-facto-IT-specialist, high-level-experimental-physicist---whatever you want call it. If it's for the web or desktop, I can probably do it. I also dabble with systems programming here and there. I'm very proficient in _HTML/CSS_, _Javascript_, _C#_, and _C/C++_. My areas of interest are _static software analysis_, and _compiler and language design_---though I'm still an undergraduate, so I'm exploring these topics at my own pace.
