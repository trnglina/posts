Well, nice to meet you! My name is Teng, but I go by _trnglina_ online. I'm an undergraduate computing science student and amateur graphics/web designer. This is my little corner of the internet, where you'll find stuff I've written, and stuff I've made.

One of my favourite (and most time consuming) hobbies is learning Japanese. That's why you'll find lots of references to Japanese popular culture wherever I've gotten my hands. I read a lot of manga, watch quite a bit of [anime](/tags/anime), and occasionally play a JRPG or two. Sometimes I'll write about these here, so please approach with caution.

When it comes to design, I'm especially interested in typography and user interface design. I believe in functional typography, organic graphics, and utilitarian user interfaces. You can find some of my [design work](/tags/design) on this site (though I warn you, it's mediocre at best).

I also enjoy writing---but want to stress that I'm no good at it. However, if you're interested in some lackluster, amateur, [fiction](/tags/fiction) or creative [non-fiction](/tags/non-fiction), you can find some on this site as well.

Finally, I'm a computing science student. I'm proficient in the web technologies (HTML/CSS/Javascript---though I'm not familiar with the popular frameworks), along with C#, F#, and C/C++. I have strong beliefs about software correctness, but I still write C/C++, so they can't be that strong.
