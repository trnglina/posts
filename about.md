Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm not a particularly interesting or accomplished person, but the navigation bar looked a little barren without an 'About' page, so here we go.

I go by _trnglina_ online. It doens't mean anything. It's not in any interesting or exotic foreign language---it's basically arbitrary.

One of my favourite (and most time consuming) hobbies is learning Japanese. That's why you'll find a lot of references to Japanese popular culture wherever I've gotten my dirty hands. I read a lot of manga, watch quite a bit of anime, and occasionally play a JRPG or two. Sometimes, I'll even play armchair critic, and put out [quick reviews](/tags/quick-review/) of whatever I feel like doing a review of, really.

I also do design for fun---which is one of those things seems either very normal, or particularly bizarre, depending on your background. I come from a pseudo-arts background myself---I've done music and visual arts (though I lacked both talent and patience). The areas I'm most interested in today are _typography_, _user interface design_, and _accessible design_. You can find some of my [design work](/tags/design) on this site.

I also enjoy writing (mostly fiction) but I want to stress that I'm no good at it whatsoever. However, if you find yourself yearning for some lackluster, amateur, [creative writing](/tags/writing), you can find some on this site as well.

Finally, I'm a programmer---software developer, coder, computer-wrangler, extremely-high-level-electric-engineer, astronomically-high-level-experimental-physicist---whatever you want call it. If it's for the web or desktop, I can probably do it. I also dabble with systems programming here and there. I'm very proficient in _HTML/CSS_, _Javascript_, _C#_, and _C/C++_. My areas of interest are _static software analysis_, and _compiler and language design_---though I'm still an undergraduate, so I'm exploring these topics at my own pace.
