The CrW is the University of Alberta's Creative Writing Club—a social group for creative writers in the university and city.

## Guest Speaker Posters

The CrW often invites figures from the local writing community to speak about their experiences and answer questions. I have helped worked alongside the Club's executive team to create a set of promotional social media posters for these events.

## Anthology Project

Starting in 2019, and progressing through 2020, the CrW produced a debut anthology featuring work by members of the club, and the greater university community. In endeavour, I created physical and digital posters for the purpose of recruiting editors and writers.
