The CrW is the University of Alberta's Creative Writing Clubâ€”a social group for creative writers in the university and city.

## Guest Speaker Posters

The CrW often invites prominent figures in the local writing community to speak about their experiences and answer questions. I have helped create a set of promotional posters for these speakers for use on social media.

## Anthology Project

Starting in 2019, and progressing through 2020, the CrW produced a debut anthology featuring work by members of the club, and the greater university community. I played a role by creating posters for the purpose of recruiting editors and writers.
