Weathering With You is an ultimate demonstration of director Shinkai Makoto's stellar directorial sense. The visuals, voice acting, music, and character writing are all spectacular. In terms of plot, the show occasionally rides the edge of disbelief, but if you let yourself get carried along by the film, you'll hardly notice it. Its brief meanderings near melodrama might put off the most cynical and critical viewers---but if you believe films should be enjoyed, Weathering with you makes it very easy.

It cuts to the female lead, Hina, who brings down her hands, originally in prayer, and looks back with a smile as beams of sunlight begin to shine down from the top-left corner." />

Weathering With You is an optimistic tale, bursting with the flavours of youth. If you have the chance, see it. If it's no longer in cinemas where you are, wait for a physical or streaming release. It's good enough to warrant a little wait.

_Weathering With You is known as Tenki no ko in Japanese._
