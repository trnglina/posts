It's not often I mention the things I want.

Not the physical stuff, of course—I'll bring those up at every opportunity—but the experiences, the sentimentalities, the occurrences… Nothing that can be shipped in via Amazon box.

It's quite late as I write this—well, late for me. Sometimes, I'd like to be able to sleep late and wake up late as well, so I can feel the evening peace, and skip the morning bustle. I might even find myself pining for clear nights, so I may greet the few old acquaintances in the sky that still outshine the city lights. I used to know the names of stars in the night sky. But while I don't any longer, they're no less wonderful. I want to take more time to appreciate them, I really do. But there's something I can't overcome—some force that keeps me inside on cold nights. Laziness, I suppose. I'd like to be less lazy, given the opportunity.

I find the peace that falls in the evenings underappreciated. In the winter, it's ushered in by the early setting of the sun. In the fading twilight, from my dark bedroom window, I can see brightly-lit living rooms, their inhabitants watching sports—hockey, inevitably. I can see dining rooms, and parents bringing in dishes of food as their two young daughters bounce impatiently on their seats. I can see a couple, their silhouettes lit only by the blue hue of some film playing, just out of view. As someone who crafts stories for fun, I find myself wanting to hear theirs. What were the things they did? What were the things that happened to them? What hurdles and obstacles did they encounter along the way? And what were the things they wanted, and the things they were denied, to make them who they are today?

I want to hear their stories, but I also want to sleep. Every day is either too long, or too short, but at their ends, I want to be able to leave the harsh gaze of my computer monitors, without feeling guilty about not having written a single line of functioning code that day. It's the holiday season, of course, but there's no rest—or no sense of it, at least. Without schoolwork to distract, every unproductive second sits like a stone in my stomach. I want to tell myself to relax more—but, I also want to do the things I want to do.

When I slide into bed, having showered and brushed my teeth, I want to be able to close my eyes, without feeling guilty about not having written a single word of a story that day. I want to turn off the lights, and fall into my own mind, without compulsively grabbing my phone to quickly make a note in a buried planning document about a potentially powerful plot point for a story that I had lost interest in over a year ago. But I want to tell stories to someone other than myself, so I want to make the note anyway, just in case.

When I can't keep my eyes open any longer, and settle in under my blankets, I want to be able to curl into a ball, without a leg cramping, or my side hurting, or my arm falling asleep before my brain does.

I want to be able to think about the day, and not relive the mortification of every imperfect action, every word I misheard and misunderstood, and every faux-pas (both the well-promulgated, and the yet-to-be-discovered) that I made.

I want to never say anything to hurt someone else. But I want to be able to raise my voice for something I believe in.

I want every person I meet to think well of me, and I want the energy to make it so.

But as I search out my window, for a moon cloaked by clouds, I want tomorrow to come.

Because there's nothing more I can do today. Everything else, both good and bad, can wait until tomorrow.
