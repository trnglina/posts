Have you seen [Kanon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1530/Kanon_2006)? It's a Kyoto Animation adaptation of a Key visual novel with supernatural elements, and focusing on the dramatic interactions between the main hero and a number of heroines... and please, stop me once you're reminded of, well, [Clannad](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2167/Clannad)? I'm not going to focus too much on the intersection between Kanon and Clannad, so I'll leave this point noting that Kanon, Clannad's predecessor as both a visual novel, and as an anime, almost never outshines its more famous younger sibling.

Instead, however, I'd like to focus on Kanon's contents a little: specifically, its ending. Without spoiling what happens explicitly, I would describe it as "unsatisfying"---unsatisfying because of how quickly it goes by, because of how unreasonable it seems, and because of how thoroughly the work had driven itself into a corner.

Let's start with pacing. Kanon's ending is fast, because it needs to be. In a sense, the pacing problem of the last episode comes from the _quality_ of the pacing in previous episodes. One of the places where I must respect Kanon is its willingness to take it slow, and let the viewer's emotions brew alongside those of the characters. Unfortunately, this leaves the last episode with a lot to resolve, and very little time to do it. As a result, it feels like a high-speed montage of emotional moment after emotional moment, hollowing the effect of each, as they lack the time to sink into the viewer.

The unreasonableness of Kanon's ending comes from a different, more fundamental place. They come from the show's view that, in a capricious world, where each of us are powerless in the face of most suffering we come into contact with, and most suffering we never even know of, the only cure that can be sought is miracle. And while I think there's a very reasonable realist root for that worldview, it makes for troublesome storytelling. When you believe we are powerless, the only thing you can show is characters addressing and working within that powerlessness. You don't get a great struggle; you don't have a villain. This is the storytelling model Kanon adopts for most of its character dramas, and most of the earlier resolutions are based in this fundamental sense of powerlessness.

At the end, however, Kanon does something rather cowardly.

Even as it explores that sense of powerlessness; even as it seeks to answer the discomfort and uncertainty that comes with powerlessness, it decides it needs a happy ending.

It fails to stick to its own answers. It cheapens the tears of its characters, and denies the very inevitability of death it had used as a dramatic tool. In the name of a happy ending, it lets "miracles"---in its own words!---sweep away every tragedy.

As a result, its remarks ultimately feel a little hollow to me. How can I listen to the answers Kanon gives me, if it's too scared to follow through on them? In facing one's mortality, Kanon provides no comfort, because, in the end, it's scared of its own premise. So instead of accepting the fortunes it set up for its own plot, and its own characters, it bets on a miracle, and rewards itself.

Kanon's ending is unsatisfying, and indulgent, and provides neither hope, nor despair. It is a coward's ending. And for that reason, it can only leave a poor taste in my mouth.
