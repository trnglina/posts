I used to stare at the ceiling fan in my room before I went to sleep. Wrapped in a blanket, with the flickers and shimmers of a city at night behind me, I traced the shapes of fan blades above me. I could pick up a pencil, place it to the air in front of my eyes, and sketch out each stroke as I followed their edges. One, two. One, two.

Nothing could beat the feeling of pencil-on-air.

Then, all of a sudden, before the lines would even begin to fade away, it would be day. The first thing I noticed, each and every morning, was the chill in my bones. The mornings still held the cold of the night, and my little room had no heater to ward it off.

When I fell asleep, alone, I used to stare at the ceiling fan, but this room has no ceiling fan. It has an air conditioner, which I can barely see out of the corner of my eye, and which glows with an ominous red light.

It's not the same at all.

Whenever my attention drifts over to the air conditioner—whenever it comes to life with a buzz and a whoosh—I can't help but feel as though there's something's wrong. It has no shape—that is unnerving enough, but I really think it's the light. It can't bleed into my vision for long before my heart begins to race.

What if it suddenly changes colours?

What if it turns off?

These little anxieties nibble away at my mind like termites at a chair. I'm going to tip over if this continues.

But what am I thinking? The machine can't _keep at it_, it simply _does_.

Maybe it's just me. Maybe I can't do it after all—sleep in someone else's house, that is.

I turn over a bit more, away from the air conditioner, and look at the back of his head. He's wrapped up in a duvet next to mine. He's my boyfriend, as of a week ago. He asked me out, and I didn't reject him, and so now, he's my boyfriend.

Though I still don't know what it means. Is it to sleep in the same room, like this? My friends gave me an scandalous look when I told them I was spending the night at his house.

I wonder why? Perhaps they knew I'd have so much trouble sleeping.

I'm reminded of the alleyway behind my house. I sometimes pass by, late in the afternoon, and see two cats—one grey, and the other, brown—sleep together. The brown one lies down first, on the warm pavement, and once he's comfortably asleep, the grey one climbs on top, and plops herself down.

I think of this as I stare at the back of his head. His hair is dark, and awfully fluffy and smooth. I can't possibly sketch it. There's no lines or edges to make out. There's nothing for a pencil to catch on—nothing to print on the air.

And his head and side are calm. They move slowly, up, and down, with the release of his breaths. The last time I looked, the clock read just past midnight. He should be deep asleep.

So I climb out; and crawling over on my knees, I raise myself up, and plop over him from the side.

The outside of his duvet is cold and smooth, even through my nightgown, but I feel I can make the best of it. I scrunch up the edge, and bring it to my face. There, the fabric is downy, and soft, and warm.

When there's no reaction, I lie like that for a while, on top of him, and really try to sleep. I imagine being that grey cat, and lazily drifting off as my soft fur rubs against his.

But it's no use. I don't have fur.

"… I can't sleep," I accidentally mumble out loud.

"Well sure, my side is really hard you know," he responds in a grumbling tone, to my surprise.

I worry that I woke him up—which suddenly occurs to me as being both likely, and incredibly rude—but he seems to read my mind.

"Don't worry, you didn't wake me up. Are you comfortable there?" he asks me instead.

"Not really," I mumble, swiftly sliding back onto my knees, and lying down on top of the duvet.

He's turned around now, so we face each other, but it's still too dark to see much. With the exception of a slight reddish hue from the air conditioner, I can't make out his face at all.

"What does it mean?—to be girlfriend and boyfriend?"

"Has that been bothering you?"

"Not really."

"Well… what, huh?" he continues, unfazed by my response, "I think it differs between people. It's all about what two people value and hold dear, I think."

"What do we value, then?" I ask, and wait, and wait, but no response comes; in that time, my heart beats louder and louder, and I feel a tightening in my chest as I begin to wonder if I had asked too forward of a question.

In that nervous tightness, I wait even longer; but like a stretched elastic, pulled longer and longer until it breaks and snaps back up at you, I too feel the need to break.

So I kick him. I wind up my leg, and knock him with the full force of my tibia.

"Ow…" he lets out in a long, high-pitched monotone.

"It's your fault," I grumble back.

"Yes, yes, I know. I was hoping you'd fall asleep if I waited long enough—but I need to think about it. You should think about it too—what do you think we should value?"

And I had to resist the urge to say that I didn't care—that I didn't know! And that he should decide, and I can go along with it, just like how this all started, last week, in that empty classroom. It's too much to think about; and it's too hard to think about, when I still know so little about him.

So instead, I let my eyes wander. They start to look for the bare line that separates the silhouette of his face from the wall—but it's no use. It's a black figure printed on black paper. There are only pieces of his face that stand out against the dark—they're the blurred edges of his big nose, the tips of his lips, and the diffusion of red light across his left cheek.

Though now, I can only think about how big his nose is. Its bulbous outline bulges against the boundaries between light and dark. I'm sure I must have the most childlike smile glaring at it, which, all of a sudden, makes me glad it's so dark. The nose is like a secret I've discovered here. It sticks out like nothing else…

… And slowly, I get to work. My pencil returns, and fits, until it falls into my hand. The air lightens. I begin to sketch—but not with the hard strokes I'm most comfortable with. Rather, I move up and down in broad shades, that diffuse the stains into the air. They start rough at first—and the shading is uneven—but I work at it. I'm determined to capture his midnight nose in all its honesty—this new, and oh-so-fascinating, view.

But like usual, it's morning before I'm done. I don't know when my eyes closed, or when I fell asleep, but I'm not thinking about those things.

Instead, I can only feel how warm it is. Strange. It was cool when I started sketching last night. I wasn't even covered.

So slowly, I open my eyes, rather comfortable and a little curious, to the sight of his t-shirt covered chest, moving slowly, up, and down, almost brushing against my face. Surprised, I retreat—slowly rolling over in the other direction, only to see his arm, reached over me, holding the duvet in place. I can't help but wonder how he fell asleep maintaining that grip.

But when I turn back around, I see his eyes are open; he's smiling, and all of a sudden, my stomach bubbles with embarrassment. It almost spreads up, through me, culminating in my cheeks, which flare up in turn.

It would be something else if he were asleep, but now, I can't help but wonder if he had fallen asleep again at all. And if he hadn't, I would feel so guilty. But surely he couldn't have held on for so long. Hours! I can hardly hold a sketchbook in my arms for so long. But I can't ask either. It would seem presumptuous—arrogant!—to think he would lose sleep for my sake.

He doesn't say anything either, so to quell the sensation, I go to hide my face, but my forehead bumps against his chest, and that just makes me shrink further.

It feels like an eternity before he finally says something:

"Good morning."

"Good morning," I respond from my position under the duvet.

There's a poignant pause in the air, before he asks:

"Does it feel different? To wake up this morning?"

"Warmer," I joke to myself, recalling the heater-less chill of the morning air I knew, and the fiery embarrassment that burns inside me now.

"I—I think it feels warmer too," he then responds, softly, twisting in so he was under the duvet as well. I look away as soon as we make eye contact. "It's like finding that warmth you felt as a kid, when you ran into your parents' bed at night," he continues slowly, as though reminiscing.

"My parents would just put me back to bed," I reminisce myself. Not to sound cynical, however; it wasn't that my parents weren't loving—they just loved from a field's length.

He doesn't respond directly, but instead, seems to choose his words:

"My parents always let me in. So since moving out, I've missed that feeling."

He then tries to look into my eyes directly, though I continue to dodge his gaze.

"I wonder if what I feel is the same as what you feel," he continues.

"I don't know," is the only answer I can give. And I glance up briefly, to see how he would react—if he would look sad, or disappointed—but he continues to smile brightly. It confuses me to the stomach, and I quickly look away again.

"And I can't know. But you feel something, right?" he asks in turn.

"I don't know."

"Then concentrate for a bit, and see if you can find it out," he says, with all sincerity, but I'm left a little miserable regardless. This is just like last night; what am I meant to feel, exactly?

I want to try though, so I unfold a little, and squeeze in closer to him. I touch my face to his chest, and wonder if, perhaps, I should be feeling more.

Instead, it just feels—

"Warm—" the words escape my mouth.

It turns out the warmth of a person is nothing like the heat of a burning stove. It's not quite warm enough, and it's not so all-encompassing, yet it's warmth nonetheless.

Then, he slides down again, and matches me, until our faces meet, just inches from each other.

And he looks into my eyes, and smiles widely. Our noses almost touch.

It feels as though I have never been so close to another person.

"We feel the same warmth then, at the very least," he says quietly.

Never before have I felt someone's warmth like this.

He looks into my eyes, but I can't quite look back. I almost want to cry—I would. But I was never one to cry when I was younger. There wasn't much point in crying by myself, in a lonely room.

And all of a sudden, I feel as though I understand the feeling.

"The warmth, what is it?"

"The warmth I'm looking for is many things."

"But that feeling your were talking about—I think I get it…" I trail off, struggling a little to get the next few words out. "I—It's about knowing someone's there for you, isn't it?" I leave with a tentative question at the end.

I glance at him—to see if he's reacted, but he doesn't say anything. He just looks at me fondly.

"I—if that's the case, then…"

I notice him turning his own head away for a brief moment.

"… Then—" I hesitate, stumbling on what to say. Nothing seems right. I can feel my chest tightening in anxiety, and my body tightening and trying to shrink away.

"Do you like it?" he finally asks in return.

"Yes," I respond automatically, as though all those anxieties melted away.

And he seems to breathe an inaudible sigh of relief himself.

"What we hold dear, huh?" I mumble after a deep breath.

"Right," he mumbles back.
