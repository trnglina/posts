In late August, Japan's longest serving Prime Minister, Abe Shinzou resigned unexpectedly and suddenly, citing health concerns.[^1] On leaving, Abe leaves behind his attempts at [economic reform](https://www.japan.go.jp/abenomics/index.html) and [constitutional amendment](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/11/21/national/politics-diplomacy/abe-constitution-hits-roadblock/), and a widely criticised COVID-19 response---despite Japan's relatively impressive outcomes so far.[^2] Even if you're unfamiliar with Japanese politics, you may have heard the news. Even if Japan isn't the economic force it once was, it's still one of the largest democracies in the world, and it's newsworthy when the three-term Prime Minister resigns without so much as a whisper beforehand.
