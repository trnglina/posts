The CrW is the University of Alberta's Creative Writing Clubâ€”a social group for creative writers in the university and city.

## Guest speaker posters

The following are promotional posters made to announce and publicise guest speakers invited by the club.

The name of the speaker, and the title of the event, 'Experiences in Writing and Anthology Running', are overlaid on top. The event started at 4:45 P.M., on Thursday January 16th, 2020, in the Heritage Lounge, located within Athabasca Hall. The group's website is at thecrwuofa.wordpress.com, and can be found at @TheCrWUofA on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.">

These posters were created shortly before the events themselves, during the earlier months of 2020. They're designed with similar layouts, and with consistent design elements between them. Their compact layouts and the emphasis on text reflect their intended use: as visual parts of promotional social media posts.

As the group became unable to proceed with in-person meetings during the pandemic, however, guest speaking events also had to adapt. The following poster(s) put a greater focus on links to the club's online-based activities.
