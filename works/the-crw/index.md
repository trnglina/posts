These posters were created shortly before the events themselves, during the earlier months of 2020. They're designed with similar layouts, and with consistent design elements between them,

As the group became unable to proceed with in-person meetings during the pandemic, however, guest speaking events also had to adapt. The following poster(s) put a greater focus on links to the club's online-based activities.
